## Inigo Meshoulam

A naturally curious and hard-working junior software developer, recently graduated from [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech/about-us/). I love to learn, and I am excited to start my career in a role where I can immerse myself and learn as much as possible while making a meaningful contribution to exciting new projects! 

As well as learning technical skills, studying at Makers has been first and foremost a self-development process. I now feel confident in my abilities to effectively break down a complex problem, plan a project to tackle it, and then execute it collaboratively using agile working techniques and coding best practices.

The reasons why tech excites me is that it is all about finding solutions to problems by creating mechanisms within specific constraints. Not just any solution however, a water-tight solution that is elegant, efficient, well-tested and robust as possible; creating, and then testing your creation!

## Skills

**Supportive**

I believe that helping others is one of the best parts of any job. Given that I had some limited prior exposure to computer science concepts before studying at Makers, I was very active in providing support and sharing knowledge with fellow cohort members and to my pair-partners. I am also currently mentoring a Makers student a few cohorts below me. I received consistent praise from fellow cohort members in our weekly retros, which I believe reflects my efforts.

**Problem-Solver**

I relish a puzzle and I am always interested in finding a more efficient/elegant solution (see my take on programming [Conway's Game of Life](https://github.com/Inimesh/game_of_life)). During my Master's research project, the vessel that I was performing my reaction in broke overnight - this was key to future work. I was able to identify other tasks I could get on with while repeating my experiment, avoiding a major bottleneck in my workflow.

**Independent Learner**

During lockdown I was unemployed without furlough and during this time I cultivated a renewed interest in computer science. I completed online courses on ML and algorithms, and started practicing coding (while led me to joining Makers Academy). The Omicron covid variant meant that the majority of the Makers course ended up being fully remote. I was able to adapt to this and remain focused and successful in my studies despite this interruption. Another example is that my Biology AS-level was completely self-taught. This took a lot of self-discipline, diligence and dedication on my part and I was successful achieving the highest grade for the qualification (A). 

**Initiative and strategy**

I believe that I am good at identifying bottlenecks and prioritising tasks. For the final project at Makers, for the first half of the week my team was getting bogged down in trying to work around an inaccessible open-banking API. This was causing us to become demoralised and anxious of approaching deadlines. I took it upon myself to re-assess our MVP and re-prioritise tasks for the team to focus efforts on building a useable proof-of-concept app with mock banking data. I believe this shift in priorities re-improved morale and led to us to have our MVP by the end of the week.

## Work Experience

**Farpoint Labs (Fintech Start-up)** (Nov 2020 - Jan 2021)  
_Data Analysis Intern_

Technologies used: Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib)

Responsibilities:
- Design a consumer surveys to identify a beach-head market for the product
- Identify the most sought after features per market group identified and deduce the most effective pricing strategy.

Achievements: 
- My research into survey design led to using a MaxDiff analysis; solving the problem of providing enough useful data while satisfying single survey length/budget requirements.
- My subsequent analysis (Python code can be found [here](https://github.com/Inimesh/Example-Data-Analysis-using-Python)) and presentation was highly praised by the CEO and other company members
- My work provided key insights for the MVP of the app and the most effective pricing strategy for each feature, which was subsequently adopted as the product roadmap.   

**Science Museum Group (London Science Museum)** (Sep 2019 - Feb 2020)  
_Explainer_

Role summary:
Active engagement with visitors; giving talks and explaining exhibits, promoting science education to families, school groups and SEN visitors. 

Achievements:
- Significantly contributed to research on exhibit topics which was well-received and used presentation scripts.
- Volunteered for feature subject talks based on collaborative and independent research, with positive feedback from visitors and line-managers.
- Effective time-management skills, keeping to a busy hourly schedule that changed daily and adapting to continuous amendment.
- Marked improvement on public speaking and presentation skills, being able to quickly adapt information to audiences with widely varying backgrounds and levels of subject knowledge.

**Hospitality** (2018 - Feb 2021)  
_Waiter/Bar Staff/Back of House_

Role summary:
- Waiter: Serving food/drinks, customer care.
- Bar Staff: Mixing + serving cocktails, customer communication.
- Back of House Supervisor: ensuring smooth operation of a 1,500 capacity roof top bar and managing colleagues.

Achievements:
- Maintaining constant and clear communication with colleagues to solve problems - these skills have helped me develop highly effective pair-programming skills.
- Understanding customer needs while ensuring a quality experience through positive engagement - these skills have helped my analysis of user stories/client requirements.
- Attention-to-detail while processing long and complex orders with efficient execution - practice in finding efficiency in tasks has helped me with ensuring code quality.
- Task prioritisation/identifying bottlenecks while working under pressure in a very busy environment - these skills have helped me plan projects and adapt to changing circumstances.
