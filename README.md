## Inigo Meshoulam

A naturally curious and hard-working junior software developer, recently graduated from [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech/about-us/). I love to learn, and I am excited to start my career in a role where I can immerse myself and learn as much as possible while making a meaningful contribution to exciting new projects! 

As well as learning technical skills, studying at Makers has been first and foremost a self-development process. I now feel confident in my abilities to effectively break down a complex problem, plan a project to tackle it, and then execute it collaboratively using agile working techniques and coding best practices.

The reasons why tech excites me are similar to why I studied Chemistry, in that it is all about finding solutions to problems by creating mechanisms within specific constraints. Not just any solution however, a water-tight solution that is elegant, efficient, well-tested and robust as possible; creating, and then testing your creation!

## Skills

**Supportive**

I believe that helping others is one of the best parts of any job. Given that I had some limited prior exposure to computer science concepts before studying at Makers, I had a head start compared to complete newcomers. As a result I was very active in providing support and learning materials to fellow cohort members and to my pair-partners. I am also currently mentoring a Makers student a few cohorts below me. I received consistent praise from fellow cohort members in our weekly retros, which I believe reflects my efforts.

**Problem-Solver**

I relish a puzzle and I actively sought out extra challenges while studying at Makers (see my take on programming [Conway's Game of Life](https://github.com/Inimesh/game_of_life)). I am always interested in finding a more efficient and elegant solution to a problem. During my year-long Master's chemical research project, my experiments suffered a wide variety of (lab and non-lab related) setbacks and issues. I was able to overcome all of these obstacles using my diagnostic capabilities, careful planning and efficient execution - achieving a first class mark for the project.

**Independent Learner**

During lockdown I was unemployed without furlough and took it upon myself to learn as much about computer science as I could, completing multiple online courses and practicing basic coding abilities. The Omicron variant meant that the majority of the Makers course ended up being fully remote. I was able to adapt to this and remain focused and successful in my studies despite this change. While in sixth form I taught myself AS level biology completely on my own during my free periods and at home. It was a task that took a lot of self-discipline, diligence and dedication in which I acheived an the highest grade for the qualification (A). 

**Initiative and strategy**

I believe that I am good at identifying bottlenecks and prioritising tasks. For the final project at Makers, my team was getting bogged down in trying to work-around an inaccessible open-banking API, which was causing us to become demoralised and anxious of approaching deadlines. I took it upon myself to re-assess our MVP and re-prioritise tasks for the team to focus efforts on building a useable proof-of-concept app with mock banking data. I believe this shift in priority re-kindled spirits and led us to becoming more productive with our time.

## Relevant Work Experience

**Farpoint Labs (Fintech Start-up)** (Nov 2020 - Jan 2021)  
_Data Analysis Intern_

Technologies used: Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib)

Responsibilities:
- Design a consumer survey to identify a beach-head market for the product (Surveymonkey)
- Identify sought after features per market group identified
- Using data analysis, deduce the most appropriate pricing strategy for these features

Achievements: 
- My research and survey design led to using a MaxDiff analysis; solving the problem of providing enough useful data while satisfying single survey length/budget requirements.
- My subsequent analysis (Python code can be found [here](https://github.com/Inimesh/Example-Data-Analysis-using-Python)) and presentation was highly praised by the CEO and other company members
- My work provided key insights for the MVP of the app and the most effective pricing strategy for each feature, which was subsequently adopted as the product roadmap.   

**Science Museum Group (London Science Museum)** (Sep 2019 - Feb 2020)  
_Explainer_

Role summary:
Actively engaging with visitors by giving talks and explaining exhibits, promoting science education to families, school groups and SEN visitors. 

Achievements:
- Significantly contributed to research on exhibit topics (mainly relating to Chemistry); this was well-received and was documented and used by colleagues.
- Successfully held voluntary special subject talks based on collaborative and independent research, with positive feedback from visitors and managers.
- Effective flexible time-management skills, keeping to a busy schedule that changed daily and was continually amended.
- Marked improvement on public speaking and presentation skills, being able to quickly adapt to audiences with varied backgrounds and levels of subject knowledge.
